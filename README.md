# RISC-V-5-STAGE-PIPELINE-PROCESSOR-
A Verilog implementation of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor based on the RV32I instruction set architecture. The design follows the classic pipeline stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB).
